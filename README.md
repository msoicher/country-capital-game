# Country Capital Game

A challenge exercised I sourced from [web dev cody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTgB4esy1is&ab_channel=WebDevCody).

## The challenge is as follows: 
1. A React Component CountryCapitalGame must take in data as a prop - an object containing key-value pairs of countries
and its corresponding capital city.
2. A button should be displayed for each country and capital, in a randomised order.
3. Clicking a button should set its background color to blue.
4. Clicking another button should:
   - remove both buttons if its a correct match.
   - set the background color of both buttons to red if its an incorrect match.

5. Assuming the previously selected pair was wrong, clicking another button should restore the buttons to its initial
   background color, and the new selected button to blue.

6. When there are no buttons left, display a message: 'Congratulations'
